# Telemetry Time Bins üêÅ

### Overview

__Kaha Sciences Mouse Telemetry System__

The [Kaha Sciences Mouse Telementry System](https://www.kahasciences.com/wireless-telemetry-overview/) allows signals like movement and temperature to be tracked over time when mice are in their home cages.
This avoids the handling of mice, which inteferes with their natural physiological function.

__Purpose__

The .ASC output from the telemetry devices show the timestamps for temperature and locomotor activity values. This repository :
* Converts this output into a time binned file.
* Separates the temperature and locomotor activity data into separate sheets. <br>

__About the labs:__ <br>
The [Lockie lab](https://www.monash.edu/discovery-institute/lockie-lab) studies how hunger signalling in the brain drives mood-related behaviour, memory, motivation and metabolism in mouse models of disease. <br>
The [Andrews lab](https://www.monash.edu/discovery-institute/andrews-lab) investigates how the brain senses and responds to hunger. <br>
The [Foldi lab](https://www.monash.edu/discovery-institute/foldi-lab) investigates the biological underpinnings of anorexia nervosa and feeding disorders. <br>
